**ADELI** is a FORTRAN 77 Finite Element software developed to model the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the crust and the lithosphere at geological time scales for 2D and 3D quasi-static problems. The analysis is performed in  large strain using the concept of objective derivative. While the space is discretized using linear elements (triangles in 2d and tetrahedrons in 3d), the time approximation is done using an explicit finite method based on the Dynamic Relaxation Method.
